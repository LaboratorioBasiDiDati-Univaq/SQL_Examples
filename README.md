# SQL_Examples

> SQL examples developed during the lectures

## Usage

This repository contains the SQL code developed during the lectures to exemplify database creation, population and querying.
The code is organized in folders corresponding to academic years (i.e., 2021 means academic year 2021/2022). 
You should only look at the files belonging to your year, since in previous editions there may be files with similar name but
very different code, not aligned with the lectures you attended.

- SQL files contain database *creation and population* code that you can directly execute in the DBMS shell.

- All the *queries* developed during the lectures, as well as advanced code such as procedures and triggers,
are included in a separate document together with examples and a brief explanation of the code.

*This code will be developed and constantly updated starting from the second half of the course, so download it frequently, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.**
